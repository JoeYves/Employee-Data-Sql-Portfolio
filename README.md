# Employee-Data-Sql-Portfolio

this repository is created to do data exploration on a dataset 'Employee Data'. As this is my first data exploration project, I used the dataset from internet randomly and got it from unknown resource.
This dataset contains:

*9 Columns* :
- Emp_ID as Text                           
- Name as Text
- Gender as Text 
- Department as Text
- Salary as Text
- Start_Date Text 
- FTE as Double
- Employee_type as Text
- Work_location* as Text
  
* **Rows** : 276.
<hr>

These columns behave differently, where there are some of the emptiness/missing values, some inconsistencies especially in start_Date columns, dates are not in one common format. some of the duplicates also are found, In Name column also, this column holds both first and last names which need to be separated. all of these should be ckecked before diving into data analysis phase.

I have been using SQL queries to do some EDA and cleaning to try to understand the concept of this unkowncompany's Employees, especially to see how employyes earn their incomes based on how salaries range varry, based on their Gender or their Departments.
