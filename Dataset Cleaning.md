SELECt  Emp_ID,Name,count(Name) from Project_Practice.data_cleaning1
group by  Emp_ID,Name
having count(Name)>1 ; 
```
OUT:

```sql
WITH No_Duplicates AS      
(select  distinct(Emp_ID)AS Dist_Emp_ID,TRIM(Name) AS Name,  
Gender, Department,  Start_Date, FTE, 
Employee_type,Salary,Work_location 
from Project_Practice.data_cleaning1
order by  Dist_Emp_ID 
)
